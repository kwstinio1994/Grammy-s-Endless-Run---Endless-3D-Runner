# Grammy-s-Endless-Run---Endless-3D-Runner

Welcome to *Grammy's Market Run*, an exhilarating 3D endless runner where you help Grammy race against time to reach the farmer's market before it closes!
## Introduction

This is an entry for the 'Games Job Fair Spring 2024 LITE - Unity Engine Programming Challenge

## Gameplay

The gameplay involves navigating Grammy through an endless course, avoiding obstacles, and collecting coins for a high score. The run concludes when Grammy hits an obstacle, with the score based on the distance covered and coins collected.

## Unique Mechanics

1. **Time Speed Increase:** The game challenges players with an automatically increasing speed, requiring quick reflexes as Grammy's run becomes faster over time, adding to the game's difficulty.

2. **World Destroyer:** Sections of the level are dynamically destroyed after Grammy passes through, optimizing game performance and focusing the player's attention on the path ahead.

3. **Coin Collection System:** As Grammy races to the market, players can collect coins that add to the score and can be used to purchase power-ups, adding a strategic element to the run.

4. **Distance Counter:** The game tracks the distance Grammy has covered. The farther she runs, the higher the score, rewarding stamina and long-term play.

5. **Score Composition:** The player's score is a combination of the distance Grammy has run and the coins collected, with multipliers for speed and efficiency, crafting a competitive scoring system that encourages replayability.
